Tester for Homework 2: Maze solver

Setup:
-modify the path in line 5, "call C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\settings32.bat", from start_test.bat to correspond with your Xilinx installation (use "settings64.bat" if you are running the 64bit version); if you followed the Xilinx install tutorial, the default path should work.
-you can change the parameters at the start of the testing module in "tester/tester.v" to see more/less debug output.

Running:
-copy your Verilog files in the root of the folder
-run (double-click) start_test.bat; results will be in "results.txt" and execution log will be in "results.log"
-you can enable the simulator GUI by changing "nogui" to "gui" in line 8 of start_test.bat
-you can run selected tests by removing unwanted ones from the "tests" folder
